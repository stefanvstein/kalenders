(ns kalenders.core
  "A library for occurrences in time. A occurrence has a begining and a
  duration. Overlapping occurences are merged into a larger occurence.
  The core occurences function creates sequence of occurences based on
  a definition and a timestamp, starting with the ongoing occurence or
  next future occurence in relation to the timestamp, followed by the
  chronologic continuing.
  A definition is a function that produces a [start-time duration] from
  a timestamp. Definitions can be combined to produce complex
  definitions of occurrence sequences"
